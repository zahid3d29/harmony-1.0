we need to make three type of settings option for theme user.

1. Theme settings
2. Customize panel settings
3. Package/Sets Settings ( will be available on Theme settings panel and Theme Customize panel)


1. Theme settings: Where user can customize theme style from theme settings panel. There will be style sets like "Color schema" or single obeject style like "Blog Card" style etc.

2. Customize panel Settings: Which will be available for each sections of theme customize panel. User can see this customization options of each sections and they can modify. example: Announcement bar section will have announcement 'text' style changing options, bar width/height/alignment options etc.

3. Package/Sets: This will be a most unique options for our theme. A set of cuastomize options together will be available on each sections and also theme settings panel. Example: A color scheme options for a section each elements color. currently there are colors scheme group we can use for background, text, button color. But, also we can make size option set there will be font size, weight, style, height etc. 

If they change a set that will effect full sections and their elements.
